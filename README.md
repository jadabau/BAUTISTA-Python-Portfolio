### 🎓 Streamlit App: Notre Dame NER Explorer  
🔗 [View the Project Repository](https://github.com/jadabau/NERStreamlitApp)  
This interactive app uses **spaCy** and **Streamlit** to let users explore custom **Named Entity Recognition** (NER). Users can upload or paste their own text, define custom entity labels and patterns (like “PLACE” or “SCHOOL”), and see entities highlighted live.

💡 Features:
- Define custom NER patterns using spaCy’s `EntityRuler`
- Upload or paste any text
- View labeled entities with an electric Notre Dame theme ☘️
- Styled with custom HTML/CSS for an interactive and branded user experience

This project combines my skills in Python, UX/UI design, and branding!
