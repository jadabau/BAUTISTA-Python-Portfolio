# Travel Pilipinas: A Cultural Explorer 🌴✨🇵🇭

## Project Overview

**Travel Pilipinas: Cultural Explorer** is an interactive Streamlit app that introduces travelers to the beautiful destinations of the Philippines. Instead of just showing maps or lists, this app curates cultural, natural, and historical highlights, plus fun trivia and local food recommendations, making it the perfect **pre-trip explorer** for tourists curious about what the Philippines has to offer.

**How it Helps**:
- Helps tourists visualize destinations before booking or traveling
- Offers curated recommendations by category (nature, history, festivals, etc.)
- Highlights unique cultural facts and local dishes, creating deeper cultural appreciation
